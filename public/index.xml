      <description>In creating visualizations, one aims not only to create a visualization that can convey the message behind the data but also to create a visualization that is appealing to the viewer. The theme function in ggplot allows for one to do so, but whenever I look at the reference page I sometimes become over whelmed by the number of components. For that reason, this post will focus on detailing non-data components of ones plot.</description>

      <description>At my work we often create visualizations that look very similar but have slight differences when it comes to aesthetics, axis limits, labels, and other attributes. However, with most visualizations in R, they all mostly have a similar structure, which is a great benefit of using ggplot. What I would traditionally do is reuse code for one visualization for another simply by copying and pasting, but as is commonly emphasized in data science, one should avoid copying and pasting more than two lines of code.</description>
