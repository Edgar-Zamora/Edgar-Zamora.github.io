      <description>At my work we often create visualizations that look very similar but have slight differences when it comes to aesthetics, axis limits, labels, and other attributes. However, with most visualizations in R, they all mostly have a similar structure, which is a great benefit of using ggplot. What I would traditionally do is reuse code for one visualization for another simply by copying and pasting, but as is commonly emphasized in data science, one should avoid copying and pasting more than two lines of code.</description>
